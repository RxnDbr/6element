### Messy ideas by creating

* I want to give/throw out something
 * Check who want this
 * Post an ad
 * Have an alert when somebody looks for something I have
* I want to get something
 * Check who got this
 * Post an ad
 * Have an alert when somebody got something I want
* Indicate personal informations to be faster (city, ...)
* Communication system : chat
* I can indicate that I gave/get ot thrown out my object easily
* Everything can be done with the app, no mail, sms, ...
* Organize garbage collection ? (Later ? )
* It works for occasional AND recursive offers / asking
* I can sort ad depending on:
 * the kind of person (particulier, pro, asso..)
 * mobility
* Create an alert if a new product matches with what we want to get (&give?)
 
* If a have a common ad, I should remove stuff I don't need anymore in this ad (automatically)
* If I like something but I want to continue to look things, I can save it in my favourite
* I can search this different kind of pieces which are connected at he same time by typing (Darwin example : "saddle dynamo foot pedal")
* can I follow smb and have a ush each time he gives smth ? 
* Can I comment ? 
* Somebody is looking for a microwave light and somebody is throwing out its : the app is enough intelligent to recognize pieces 
* If I am looking for a part of a whole (saddle for instance), I have also ads about the appropriate whole (bike)
* Point system when you give and when you delete an old ad (be carreful, it's harsh to attribute a value to a waste. And difficult to compare a piece of wood with a cellphone. "It's unfair" . 
* Point when you go at a place to give an object and/or money ? It could make the price lower
* It is easy to give a lot of things at the same time
* The person which is interested and who drives can propose to go on RC for the person in exchange of their stuff
* I want to organize a regular collect : how to do ?????????????
* Can we pay smb him to go in RC for you ?


## 6element
* I have a favourite RC
 * Can I go now?
 * When should I go?
 
* I have specific trashes to throw out
 * What kind of trash is it (help me to know what is it)?
 * Where can I go? 
  
   *NB: If my trash is peculiar, there is a chance that I lend a truck to transport it and have no choice about when going*
  
* I only can throw my trashes out on *Sunday*
 * Where can I go?
 
* I am a professional and I want to know where is the best place me to go/the most favourable
 * Depending on organisation (price, authorisation, ...) 
 * Depending on kind of trashes
 
* I just want to know in which category is my trash

* It works yet
